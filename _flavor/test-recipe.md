A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that originated in the United States and features chocolate chips as its distinguishing ingredient.

The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Variations include recipes with other types of chocolate as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal.
