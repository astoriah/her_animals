What is growing in my garden right now? 

I built a garden box in late June hoping to catch the tailend of the tomato planting before it got too late into the summer.

## Strawberries 

I bought 5 Everbearing Strawberries from Fred Meyer for $1 each! All of them survived transplant shock and are flourishing, I was impressed.

They love full sun and are so happy in the garden box. In just two weeks, they more than doubled their leaves and began flowering. 

I found that ants were attracted to the strawberry flowers, so at night when watering -- I tried to wash the ants off of the flowers and stems of the plant. So far all leaves, flowers, and fruits are untouched.

I cannot wait to try the strawberries when they ripen in a few weeks!
