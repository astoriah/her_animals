One of the most obnoxious weeds that is growing in my backyard is the Sticky Willy (Galium aparine). It is a vine-like plant with a sticky stem and tiny round sticky seeds. They love climbing ontop and through the invasive blackberry bushes and attempted to choke it. 


I found that pulling long strings of this plant is quite statisfying and therapeutic -- so I have decided for myself and good land management that I must focus my efforts of ridding it out of the backyard.

See how satisifying it is before and after I clear an area of this weed:

Now you can actually see the blackberry bush and the its flowers! 

This plant has shallow roots which makes it easy to come out of the ground when yanked, but its sticky stems allows it to catch on to EVERYTHING it touches and scattering the round ball seeds.
