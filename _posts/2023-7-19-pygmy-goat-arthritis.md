One of the common conditions that pygmy goats have when they get older is arthritis. Because they are built with a large body and short small legs, they often develop joint inflamation as they grow older. 

Artemis, my oldest goat, turned 11 this year and she is beginning to show symptoms of arthritis. She prefers to lie down when the others are grazing. And when getting up from sleeping, she is tender on one of her back legs. 

From general reading online, I didn't find much on goat arthritis besides on CAE. What can we do to relieve some of her pain? How can we support joint health and reduce inflammation?
