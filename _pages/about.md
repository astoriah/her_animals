Her Animals is a blog about hobby farming, raising pygmy goats, and gardening.  

Astoria grew up in California and moved to Washington State in 2022. She currently has 6 pygmy goats, 2 dogs, 1 cat, and 2 rabbits.

Growing up, Astoria was apart of 4-H where she raised and showed pygmy goats, sheep, rabbits, chickens, cavies, and dogs. She also volunteered at the Wildlife Center of Silicon Valley and Deer Hollow Farm.

Through this blog, she hopes to share her experience raising pygmy goats and caring for aging animals.
